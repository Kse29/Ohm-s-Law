# Ohm-s-Law
I created an interface for Ohm's Law. The 1st page contains a "Start" button, and the 2nd page is a login page with a code to enter. that allows calculating Ohm's Law (3rd page), calculating the series and parallel resistance combinations, and a potentiometric circuit (4th page). Then, it calculates the voltage across each resistor and their dissipated power (Joule effect) (5th page).
